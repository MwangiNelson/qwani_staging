QWANI BLOG UPDATE - STAKEHOLDER SUMMARY
========================================

Hi Team,

We've completed a major update to the Qwani blog platform. Here's what's changed:


WHAT'S NEW
----------

1. FRESH NEW LOOK
   
   The blog pages now have a modern, magazine-style design that's more 
   visually appealing and easier to read. We've introduced elegant 
   typography and refined colors that give the platform a more 
   professional, editorial feel.


2. IMPROVED BLOG LISTING PAGE
   
   - Featured article now displays prominently at the top with a 
     large image
   - Trending stories section with a smooth horizontal carousel
   - Category filters to help readers find content by topic
   - "Load More" button instead of loading everything at once
     (faster page loads)


3. BETTER BLOG READING EXPERIENCE
   
   - Clean, distraction-free reading layout
   - Larger, more readable text
   - Author information displayed more prominently
   - Images load faster and have smooth fade-in effects


4. USER COMMENTS WITH SIGN-IN
   
   Readers can now leave comments on blog posts! Here's how it works:
   
   - Users click to comment and see a sign-in popup
   - They can sign in with Google (one click) OR create an account 
     with email/password
   - New users accept terms & conditions when registering
   - Once signed in, they can post comments
   
   IMPORTANT: All new comments go through moderation. They won't 
   appear publicly until an admin approves them. This helps maintain 
   quality and prevents spam.


5. COMIC READER UPGRADE
   
   For comic content, readers now have three ways to enjoy:
   
   - LEFT-TO-RIGHT: Traditional Western comic style
   - RIGHT-TO-LEFT: Manga/Japanese style (pages flow backwards)
   - VERTICAL SCROLL: Modern webtoon style (scroll down through panels)
   
   Plus: zoom controls, dark mode for comfortable reading, and 
   fullscreen mode.


6. REFRESHED ABOUT PAGE
   
   The About page now has a more dramatic, engaging design with:
   - Large hero section
   - Animated statistics
   - Value cards that highlight what Qwani stands for
   - Better team member display


7. NAVIGATION BAR
   
   The top menu now has a subtle dark background that becomes more 
   solid as you scroll. This makes it easier to read on all pages.


TECHNICAL NOTE FOR ADMINS
-------------------------

There's one database change needed: A new "status" field for comments 
that tracks whether they're pending, published, or rejected. The 
development team will provide the SQL command to run.


WHAT THIS MEANS FOR USERS
-------------------------

- Faster page loading
- Easier navigation
- More enjoyable reading experience
- Ability to engage through comments
- Multiple ways to read comics


NEXT STEPS
----------

1. Review the changes on the staging/development environment
2. Run the database migration for comment moderation
3. Test the sign-in flow (both Google and email)
4. Approve for production deployment


Please reach out if you have any questions or feedback!

Best regards,
Development Team
